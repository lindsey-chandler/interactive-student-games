Note: This section is an addendum for the lesson Interactive Fiction in the Humanities Classroom: How to Create Interactive Text Games Using Twine. This is an expansion of the part of Saving Your Game section which reads, “It is possible to share your Twine game by distributing the HTML file. You can do this by emailing it, uploading it to a file hosting platform (like DropBox), or hosting it online. You might consider uploading your Twine game to Github, or to a game hosting platform like itchio." 

 
Begin addendum text:  

The HTML file that you receive from Twine can be modified as the “back-end” of the game, or hosted on a platform which distributes the executed HTML file. If you would like to distribute the HTML file, you can use a file hosting platform such as DropBox or Github. If you want to host your game online as a ready-to-play option, you may consider a game hosting platform such as itchio.  

This section focuses on creating a ready-to-play, shareable option through itchio (http://itch.io), an independent hosting platform for video games. To upload files to share, you will first need to create an account. You can register for a new account by clicking the Register button at the top right of the homepage. itch.io allows you to create an account with a username and password, or link your Github account through the Other registration methods option.  

Once you log in, you will be taken to the Creator Dashboard where you can examine projects, analytics, and more. To create a shareable game, you will create a new project. Click on the red “Create a new project” button on the left side of the page to get started.  

When you create a new project, you will see a variety of options for customizing the published look of the game. This includes cover art and screenshots of the gameplay if you want your students to preview content, or even a trailer or video which describes gameplay. This might be useful if your students are using the game outside of class time, or if you want to make your game attractive to a wider audience. This is also a useful option if you want your game to be listed as part of a professional portfolio. 

The following information fields are useful for students or others to identify your game:  

 

Title: This is what you want your game to be called, and how your students will identify it.  

Project URL: You can customize the path to make linking easier and more informative.  

Short description or tagline: This appears on itch.io with a link to the project. It should be informative but not too lengthy, nor should it duplicate the title of the game.  

Classification: In this case, if you are uploading a Twine file, you are uploading a Game - a piece of software you can play.  

Kind of project: If you are uploading a file, choose the HTML option so that students can play your game through their internet browsers.  

Release status: This describes the state of completion of your project. If you are ready to launch, it might be more complete. If you are still in draft mode, then In Development or Prototype might be more appropriate.  

 

Because itch.io is a site which operates in part through user funds and it is a site which promotes the credit and appropriate payment to authors, the project details will also include a section about Pricing, or payment that you might require people to make to access your game. If you want your game to be freely available, especially for students, then the “No payment” option is the appropriate choice. This means that no individual will be prompted to make a payment or donation to use your game.  

The next and most important Uploads section is where you will add your HTML file. Click the red Upload files button, or if your file is hosted on DropBox, you can draw it from there. Choose the file from your system browser to add it to itch.io. If your file exceeds 1 GB in size, you will have to contact itch.io for more hosting space.  

When your HTML file has been added, one additional setting for embedding options will appear below. This sets how you want your game to be run. You can choose for students to run the game in the project page screen, or you can choose for them to launch and view the game in full screen mode. If you want a fully immersive experience, full screen mode is ideal. If students will have to use other information, other web pages, or other apps while they play, then embedding in the webpage might be ideal instead so they avoid switching between full screens and other apps while playing. If you choose to run the game in the browser instead of full screen, you can set the size of the game, or have the itch.io platform auto-detect the most appropriate size. You can also select options for mobile-friendly enabling or scrolling within the game, perhaps if reading is required or if the information does not fit within one frame.  

Once you have added your HTML file, it’s time to add details about your game! This long description of your game will outline the game goal, play style, and any information that students (or other players) might need to complete the game successfully. Think about the following questions to help you:  

 

What is the main objective of the game? 

What is the game format? For example, is it a story, escape room, or something else?  

What information or skills do players need to play the game successfully?  

What other information such as scene-setting or background do you want to provide before gameplay begins?  

 

Next, to categorize your game on the itch.io platform, you will choose a Genre and add Tags. If you are uploading a game for students, Education might be most appropriate, but ultimately the choice for most appropriate Genre is up to you. Tags will help users find your game on itch.io. You can also link your game in other app or game hosting platforms, and allow itch.io to refer to your game by another name. These are extremely custom settings that you would use if you want your game to have a polished, professional feel.  

In the Community section, you can choose how individuals interact with and comment on your game. If you don’t want users to be able to comment or interact, then the “Disabled” setting is most appropriate. You can enable comments if you want users to be able to add comments or notes about your game below the executable game on its project page.  

Finally, you will choose the visibility setting for the game. You must first opt to save your game page as a Draft until you are satisfied with your settings or the final HTML version of the game. Once you have saved the game as a Draft for the first time, then you can change the visibility settings to Public. Only change these settings once you are ready for your students to view the game in its most current version.  

Once you are satisfied with all of your game settings, click the red Save & view page button at the bottom of the settings page. Once the project is saved, you will be redirected to the project page. Notice that the URL to which you are redirected is the one you can share with your students.  

If you need to upload new versions of the HTML file, from the project page, click on the gray Edit project link in the top left of the window. You will be taken back to the settings page. Under the Uploads section, upload the latest version that you want to share. Once it uploads, you will see options appear for all files associated with the game. For the version you want users to see, click on the checkbox “This file will be played in the browser.” To hide other versions of the game, click on the checkbox “Hide this file and prevent it from behind downloaded” for each version you do not want to be available.  

Once you have uploaded the latest version and adjusted settings to your liking, click the red Save button at the bottom of the page. You will now see a link to your published project on your itch.io dashboard. To see the project page, click on the title from your Dashboard. Once again, the URL to which you are directed is the one you can share with your students or users! You have now completed the process of uploading an executable version of your Twine game for students to enjoy!
