This repository is one that contains code and instruction documentation for interactive games that are used in the classroom. These games increase student engagement, connect their active learning to course-set objectives, and expose learners to different technological tools beyond the simple lecture-assessment presentation format in higher education.

The repository currently contains the following game(s): 
* Escape Room for LA 83: First Year Seminar in Liberal Arts (First deployed in Fall 2023)

To incorporate one or more of these games into your own class, you must download the given files which contain the game structure and content, as well as all associated materials for game completion. You may also provide a link to the game file to students to run directly in their web browsers. Otherwise, the file(s) will need to be hosted in your own space, such as a learning management system (LMS) or other game hosting platform. The author recommends itch.io as an acceptable, free platform for game hosting and sharing.
